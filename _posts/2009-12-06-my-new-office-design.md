When I was designing my office where, at least 20 people are to be seated, one of the architects suggested to go in for a closed office set up. Where as the other guy who is an interior decorator and close friend of mine came out with the idea of an open office with needed partitions and boxes. I was indeed in a dilemma to choose the best. During the course of my decision making process, I stumbled upon a relevant article in a newspaper which had conducted survey among the employees of various firms to find out their reaction to the open and closed office space. The study clearly indicated that almost all the employees preferred a closed office atmosphere to give a better turn out than an open office. In 90 % of the research conducted, it was proven beyond doubt that the outcome of working in an open office was found to be negative with lesser output.

Working in an open office leads to stress, conflict and high blood pressure among the staff members. Open office often found to be noisy with the jangling telephones and bleeping computers. The privacy for the staff is lost and he works under stress always. One of my business partner suggested that the open office space saves as much as 20% of the costs. But I decided to ahead with the traditional design of a small, private closed office where the employee enjoys privacy and works in a conducive atmosphere without clashing with his co worker delivering the best out of him.
