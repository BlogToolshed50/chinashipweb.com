My favorite part about watching the world cup is seeing players that are normally only seen on highlight plays. This show what a great player can do with his club team, but watching him perform for his country takes on a whole new meaning. With patriotic pride on the line, many superstars raise their performance to a whole new level. This means that the greatest football in the world is played on the biggest stage.

Being able to marvel at these individuals while watching on cable tv in Washington is incredible. Their athleticism is something to behold over an entire 90 minutes. Being able to play 45 minutes without a real break has to be quite a feat, especially considering the other side is also featuring the greatest collection of players from one country. When the fact that there are only 32 teams invited from the whole world, it is truly mind boggling.

I sometimes get caught up in the antics up a superstar who is dead one minute, then scoring the winning goal the next, that I forget how truly special these players are and what it takes to play at the highest level. The world cup only comes around every 4 years and I don&#8217;t want to miss a second of the great action.
