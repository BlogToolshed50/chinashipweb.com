This guest post from Werner Rogers

I love living in a small town, out in the country. Getting to see the stars at night, knowing everyone in the community and living close to our family is perfection to me. But there are definitely times that I wish I lived closer to a big city. After building our dream home about two years ago, my husband and I were so excited to move in. Once we moved in, we had all of these big plans to decorate rooms certain ways, purchase nice art and create the perfect outdoor entertainment area. The one thing holding us back from this is the fact that we live no where close to any stores that sell exactly what it is that we want.

I solved this problem by using my clear internet DIRECT TV bundle to find the perfect pieces for our home. I have purchased around seventy percent of the items in our home online. Being able to get online and shop for exactly what I am envisioning in my head has actually been better than going to shops and stores to find home decor items. Not only have we been able to find items that we love, but also we have been able to really personalize our home. None of our friends or family have any of the same pieces of furniture or accessories that we have.
