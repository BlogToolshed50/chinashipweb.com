Every teenager is going to face some amount of stress in their lives, from the family, for their grades, in getting a job, in getting their drivers license, stress with friends, stress and drugs, and so much more. Helping your child through stressful times in their life is going to be important. As you teach your teen to handle stress, and not to handle stress for them, but on their own, you are going to be teaching them life skills. 

Your teen is going to face stress, when grades come out. To fight the stress about grades, talk to your teen about how they are doing in school all the time, not just at report card time. Voice options, such as, if they get a bad grade, offer to help them learn the subject. Spend extra time learning about history or calculus and get the teen interested in getting a better grade. To get a better grade, a teen has to work hard all semester. One failing grade can be overcome and shouldnâ€™t be a matter of too much stress. Avoid the stress of failing for the year by giving your teen the opportunity of a tutor, or of your own abilities in that subject.
