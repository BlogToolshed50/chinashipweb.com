1. The first thing you have to do is to reduce the amount of red meat in your daily diet. You should replace it with white meat and fish.

2. It is absolutely necessary for you to eliminate less saturated fats. Begin consuming skimmed milk, low cholesterol cheese, and other &#8220;light&#8221; products.

3. A healthy diet will ultimately result in a healthy digestion. Foods that are high in fiber will help you lower cholesterol by eliminating the dietary fats.

4. Stop frying your food and start grilling them. It prevents the loss of vitamins from the vegetables and therefore you will eat healthier.

5. Stop being a lazy and start exercising more. You can do aerobics, walk, jog, or even play basketball.

6. Tropical oils will not do any good. If you want to get a lower cholesterol level you must start using vegetable or canola oils.

7. Always read the label on the food products you are buying to be sure of what you are buying in terms of fat levels.

8. Drinking will not exactly be your best activity during a diet due to the fact that it can ruin your efforts. On the other hand, the latest research has shown that a glass of red wine per day can lower cholesterol.

9. A cholesterol lowering medication prescribed or recommended by a physician will have maximum effectiveness for your diet if you will use it wisely.

10. Always remember that a diet for reducing cholesterol level will definitely help you lose weight.

Just follow these simple steps and you will not only reduce bad cholesterol but also maintain a healthy body.
