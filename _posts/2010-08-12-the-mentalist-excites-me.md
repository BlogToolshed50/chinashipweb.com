My husband and I enjoy eating popcorn as we watch our favorite show in HD on DirectTV. Each week we enjoy watching the new hit show called The Mentalist. I love the quality of the picture because it brings out the beauty of Simon Baker&#8217;s eyes. Simon Baker plays a character named Patrick Jane and he does a wonderful portrayal. When he was younger, he perfected the ability to read people and now he works with the California Bureau of Investigations to solve crimes using his techniques. The supporting cast is amazing. The cast consists of a diverse group of characters. Each character builds off the other and that makes for interesting television viewing. Patrick Jane has an archenemy named Red John. I am very interested to see what they are going to do in the coming season between these two characters. I am sure if Patrick Jane ever caught Red John then that would completely change his character and I am not ready for that yet. I really enjoy this police style drama with characters that each have great comedic timing.
