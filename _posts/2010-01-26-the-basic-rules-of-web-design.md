Basic Rules of Web Design the most important rule in web design is that your web site should be easy to read. What does this mean? You should choose your text and background colors very carefully. You don&#8217;t want to use backgrounds that obscure your text or use colors that are hard to read. Dark-colored text on a light-colored background is easier to read than light-colored text on a dark background. You also don&#8217;t want to set your text size too small (hard to read) or too large. All capitalized letters give the appearance of shouting at your visitors.

Keep the alignment of your main text to the left, not cantered. Center-aligned text is best used in headlines. You want your visitors to be comfortable with what they are reading, and most text is left aligned. Your web site should be easy to navigate

All of your hyperlinks should be clear to your visitors. Graphic images, such as buttons or tabs, should be clearly labeled and easy to read. Your web graphic designer should select the colors, backgrounds, textures, and special effects on your web graphics very carefully. It is more important that your navigational buttons and tabs be easy to read and understand than to have &#8220;flashy&#8221; effects. Link colors in your text should be familiar to your visitor, if possible. If you elect not to use the default colors, your text links should be emphasized in some other way like boldfaced, a larger font size, set between small vertical lines, or a combination of these. Text links should be unique &#8211; they should not look the same as any other text in your web pages. You do not want people clicking on your headings because they think the headings are links.

Your visitors should be able to find what they are looking for in your site within three clicks. If not, they are very likely to click off your site as quickly as they clicked on. your web site should be easy to find

How are your visitors finding you online? The myth, &#8220;If I build a web site, they will come,&#8221; is still a commonly held belief among companies and organizations new to the Internet. People will not come to your web site unless you promote your site both online and offline.

Web sites are promoted online via search engines, directories, award sites, banner advertising, electronic magazines and links from other web sites. If you are not familiar with any of these online terms, then it is best that you have your site promoted by an online marketing professional. 

Web sites are promoted offline via the conventional advertising methods: print ads, radio, television, brochures, word-of-mouth, etc. Once you have created a web site, all of your company&#8217;s printed materials including business cards, letterhead, envelopes, invoices, etc. should have your URL printed on them.
