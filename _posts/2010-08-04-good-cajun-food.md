Last week while I was setting my security choice alarm before I left the house for work, I noticed a takeout menu that I had stuck to the refrigerator door. It belonged to Crescent City Cafe, my favorite Cajun restaurant in the city. I thought about it all day at work and decided to take the family out for dinner at night. We arrived at the small restaurant whose facade is reminiscent of a French Quarter home and were promptly seated. It was a Thursday night, one of their least busy days of the week. Looking over the menu, I noticed that the selections had changed since the last time I was there. All of my favorites like the gumbo and fried catfish were still on the menu, but other, more upscale dishes were available. My wife was pleasantly surprised to find duck, one of her favorites, on the menu. I began my meal with a small green salad topped with blue cheese and a tangy vinaigrette. The crisp and slightly bitter greens were the perfect foil to the dressing and the creamy cheese. After that, I had my favorite dish, the shrimp Creole. Large, succulent prawns were perfectly seasoned and bathed in a rich, tomato sauce with a touch of heat. The sweetness of the shrimp played magnificently with the slight piquancy of the sauce to create an exquisite dish. We finished off the evening with a traditional bread pudding. The meal was rich, but we hardly go out except for special occasions. With meals this good, though, we may be eating out more often.
