According to the Center for Addiction and Mental Health, approximately one in five children between the ages of four and 16 have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. If untreated, such conditions can lead to drug addiction, dropping out of school and, in more severe cases, criminal behavior.

Until recently, doctors and researchers rarely considered that children could suffer from mental disorders. But studies have shown that many do in fact live through a lot of the same frightening symptoms experienced by adults.

One thing parents can do to reduce the chances that their children will suffer from mental illness is to provide a positive social and emotional environment. Here is a list of things that parents can do to help foster healthy mental development in their children:

* Give lots of unconditional love. Play with them often.

* Remind them of their achievements frequently. This helps boost their self confidence and self esteem.

* Provide them with the opportunity to play with other children by setting up play dates and enrolling them in group activities.

* Encourage teachers and care givers to be supportive and aware of your kids&#8217; emotional states and needs.

* Provide safe and secure surroundings.

* Offer appropriate guidance and discipline. Enforce limits. Explain consequences.
