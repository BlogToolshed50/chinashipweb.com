My daughter is always suprising me with all the funny little things that she does. She&#8217;s a little quirky but that just makes her all the better. Last year she dressed up as Frankenstein the monster and it was a riot to see a little girl dressed up liek that and growling all over the place. So this year she really surprised us when she said that she was going to be Frankenstein&#8217;s bride.

So I started trying to find a way to make that infamous wig for her when I found clearwirelessinternet.com and decided to switch over our internet service to it.

After that I finally found some directions for a Bride of Frankenstein wig and started working on it. Luckily, that&#8217;s going to be the only hard part of the costume. I&#8217;m making a simple dress for her to wear and already have a pattern for it so it won&#8217;t take hardly any time to put together. IÃ•m also just going to pick up some cheap Halloween makeup to paint her face really white.
