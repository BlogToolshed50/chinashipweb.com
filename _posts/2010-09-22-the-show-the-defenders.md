Guest post of the week by Deangelo Spencer

I am so excited about the new show starting on CBS this season. It is called The Defenders and we plan to watch it on our directv around Denver. It has Jim Belushi in this show. He is so funny and I can not wait to see him back on TV again. I have missed him ever since According to Jim was canceled a few years ago. He is a lawyer in this show, but it has a comedy quick to it. It is going to be a very funny show from watching the previews about it. I am excited to see if it is different than the other shows on television right now. I am always looking for something different to watch that will put me in a good mood and that will get me laughing. I think this is one that my husband will watch with me too. We are going to try it out and see if it is as good as they are saying this one is going to be so far. It is getting great reviews.
