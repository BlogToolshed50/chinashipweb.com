Performing magic tricks for people is always fun. I can honestly say I will never get bored or tired of doing magic tricks for people as long as I live. There is something about getting that reaction of disbelief from people. Having that satisfaction just for a moment that what your spectators just witnessed you do, may have indeed been real magic. To be able to put doubt in their head, even know they know it really is just a &#8220;trick&#8221;, they some how start to question themselves that maybe, just maybe, you truly are magical. Just to watch someone&#8217;s eyes, the laughter, and even the odd screams, it is something I will always cherish and continue to appreciate when I perform magic tricks. But there is something a little more special when doing magic tricks for specific people. The people that I am referring to are kids.

The Imagination of Kids

Magic tricks and kids is quite a combination. Kids seem to have a very different perception of the world than adults. What goes on in their little minds, I don&#8217;t think we will ever understand or grasp but it is pure entertainment and just plain innocent fun. For instance, when I performed a very famous coin trick for a little boy, the boy was maybe 6 years old, his expression and the words that came out of his mouth were priceless. I made the coin disappear in front of his eyes and did the classic move of pulling the coin out from his ear. Well, this boy&#8217;s mouth went as wide as the moon, I mean I could of just put my hand in his mouth and easily removed his tonsils for him, hopefully he won&#8217;t need that done down the road, but it&#8217;s those type of reactions that I love. Then, the words that end up coming out that mouth are even more priceless. Something that you can never prepare yourself for, and I quote, Wow, can you pull more money out of my ear so I can buy a new bike!. Well, I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing for about a minute, I am not sure if he understood what just happened but it&#8217;s instances like these where reality just doesn&#8217;t matter, just pure innocent fun.

Magic in their Eyes

Kids alone, just being themselves, bring their own type of magic to us. One place that comes to my mind is Disney World. When kids see or hear about Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck, their eyes light up, a smile comes to their face, just a magical glow all around. I get this same look when I pull a rabbit from a hat, or make a worm crawl out of my pocket and onto my arm. It&#8217;s really not hard to make kids laugh and be astonished at what you do. You know they are not out there to try and figure out how you did that or try and spoil your magic trick, they are there to be entertained, they are there for the magic.
