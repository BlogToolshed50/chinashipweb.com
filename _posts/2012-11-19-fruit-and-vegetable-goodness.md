The main excuse from many Americans for not buying fruits and vegetables is that they are too expensive. Although foods that aren’t in season can be a bit expensive, one can get a colorful variety of fruits and vegetables for approximately the same price that they are spending on fast food or processed food. For example, frozen fruits and vegetables contain most of their nutrients and can be used as a substitute when those certain foods are not in season. Also, fruit and vegetable drink mixes have excellent supplemental sources of some of the nutrients that our body needs the most. A survey by the American Institute of Cancer Research discovered that many adults don’t eat their vegetables because of a fear of flatulence. For those people who are not used to the fiber in fruits and vegetables, they may experience this problem, but people who eat fruits and vegetables daily don’t experience this problem because their systems are already used to it. Starting slowly or cooking vegetables can help the body to adapt.

Although fruit and vegetable drink mixes aren’t meant to replace whole foods, they are supplements made from whole foods, which happen to absorb very easily in the gut, and contain healthy doses of fiber as well. These supplements, which are very helpful during a nutritional gap or a tough schedule, contain vegetables, fiber, and sometimes grasses. Even if you are already eating a healthy 5-a-day diet, these drink mixes can provide you with an extra dose of fiber. The best fruits and vegetable drink mixes are offered in a large spectrum of colors and are also great-tasting.
