Thanks to my friend Jeremy Dellinger for the post.

I like animals, but I don&#8217;t want to be a pet owner because of the responsibility. My solution to this was to search on the hughesnet internet to find a pet that is easy to take care of and will satisfy my need to be around an animal. Luckily, I was able to find the coolest pet ever. I originally found it on Brookstone.com and the product is called an ecosphere. In the Ecosphere lives four baby red shrimp, algae and microorganisms. It was originally developed for NASA and is like a mini globe in itself. The globe is enclosed and never required food or changing of the water. The only thing I have to do is put the Ecosphere in indirect sunlight for 8 hours a day.

I have blogged about my Ecosphere to others who are pet lovers. They think the only real pet is a furry one you can touch. What I find is that caring for my little shrimps makes me feel happy and I think of them as pets. I make sure to put them in the sun every day and soak up their nutrients. When children come over they are excited to see my pets. I like to post pictures on Facebook for everyone to see. Nearly everyone is shocked that I have baby shrimps as pets that do not require food.
