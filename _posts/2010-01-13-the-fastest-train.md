It was quite interesting and satisfying to read the news that China has joined the band wagon of countries boasting for the fastest trains. Recently, they have introduced the fastest train that can run 350 KM per hour. As such, the train is capable of covering as much as 1069 KM between Guangzhou and Wuhan in a matter of three hours.

Earlier the places were covered by trains taking seven and half hours. The technocrats vouch that the super fast train can go at a speed of 394.20 KM per hour. If any one compares the speed of the fastest run trains in various countries, it is 243Km in Japan while the same runs at 277Km per hour in France.

Each and every country is embarking on an ambitious plan to improve the infra structure facility and especially, the transportation. Introducing the metro trains many developing countries are trying to reduce the congestion and improve the efficiency and better utilization of the available space.

In fact the statistics shows that, China is aiming to increase the national train network from the current 86000 KM to 120,000 Km to become the second largest and extensive rail system next to the USA. Maybe in the days to come we can expect other nations to follow suit and introduce the fastest train for the convenience of the public with modern facilities.
