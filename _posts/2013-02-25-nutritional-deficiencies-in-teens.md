Deficiency is one of the most common nutritional disorders, and adolescents are at special risk &#8211; up to 13 per cent of teenage boys and girls were found to have low iron stores. Rapid growth, coupled with a fast lifestyle and poor dietary choices, can result in iron-deficiency. Teenage girls need to pay particular attention to iron because their iron stores are depleted each month following menstruation.

During adolescence there a high incidence of nutritional deficiencies and poor eating habits. This may lead to consequences in later years including osteoporosis, obesity, hyperlipedemia, sexual maturation delays, and final adult height. In addition, the development of eating disorders is very prominent during this period. Nutritional surveys have indicated that the highest prevalence of nutritional deficiencies occur during adolescence

Such kids love detecting labeling tricks or seeing how much air and how little cereal goes into those giant boxes, or discovering that food manufacturers replace real fruit with food dyes and artificial flavors.
