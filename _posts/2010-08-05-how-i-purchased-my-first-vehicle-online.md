Thanks for the post from Barney Crosby

I purchased my first car about a month ago and most of it was done using satilight internet. I used my satellite internet service OK to get on the web and search for dealerships in my area. I wasn&#8217;t interested in a specific car because I had a low budget. I was able to surf dealerships and look at the different vehicles they had on hand.

I found a car that was a Toyota and had low miles, so I filled out a credit application and requested more information. I was able to research the VIN number online and get a report on the car and any accidents that it was in. The car was in good shape as far as I could see with pictures.

I went and got a friend of mine, who is a mechanic, and took the car for a test drive. I purchased the vehicle without a ton of paperwork because I was already approved online. I also used the internet to find a DMV close to me. In just a few minutes I had insurance that covered the car, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about driving the car without coverage.

Purchasing a vehicle with the help of the Internet, got me on the road faster than looking around in person. I was very organized and had a plan before I ever saw the vehicle. One of the best ways for me to find something in my price range was to look online and apply for financing first.
