You: an aspiring artist, creating song after song but not having the results. It just doesn’t measure up to what you expected. It’s not like what you hear on the radio.

How many songs will it take? Well, soon you realize the songs you listen to have something going on. What’s the secret? The songs you hear and the masses hear and pay attention to have the correct ingredients. That’s right is takes a proper recipe to write successful, listenable and impressionable music.

How do we know this? You’re still writing songs and maybe 25 or 50 songs later you still haven’t produced something you like. Or, when you play your tune for others, within a minute or less, they are talking or just not listening.

If easily distracted you know this song does not have what it takes.
  
It doesn’t come close to the songs you hear on the radio or the music you buy. Why?

All the songs do in fact have what is takes. The recipe and ingredients have been used! Without it you know it just won’t turn out.
  
Try baking a cake and leave out some part or skip a step and what do you get?
  
Cakes that don’t taste right or makes you go WOW! The same happens with song writing.

Take any hit song and break it down.

First of all, people as a whole have a short attention span. We will get bored and side tracked. It’s human nature. As a song writer it’s imperative to capture your listener quickly and hold them to the task. How?

You have to TELL A STORY one that people can relate to. Like romance, work, nature, something people can relate to. Choose words that keep with the story and have it make sense. Something too outlandish seems to throw the attention span out the window.

Keep it short and sweet! Five minute plus songs are too long. We humans get bored. Three, three and a half minutes seems just right.

Have parts such as Verse 1 then Chorus back to Verse 2 then Chorus and maybe a small bridge, to chorus and out, or another verse and out. By this time the 3 minute mark should be right there.
