Skin Care has become so vital nowadays due to the frequent changes in the temperatures and the polluted atmosphere. Exposure to cold climate makes the skin dry. The food habit of the people also affects the skin heavily. Too much of fatty food is found to be causing damage to the body skin in the long run. Though there are many skin care products available in the market to maintain the health of the skin they are all fundamentally made of synthetic products to give instant relief.

Still people suggest the conventional methods to maintain the skin that is found to be the best and long lasting remedy. I have been practicing a natural way of maintaining the glowing skin for so many years and found that the practice offering me the desired result without any side-effect. One can easily try this to get the best benefit to the skin glowing always without becoming dry. Take little honey with lemon juice and add the egg white to this mixture. This combination is to be applied to the skin and the face leaving the area of lips and the eyes. I am leaving for about 25 minutes and wash it off with mild Lukewarm water. If this practice continued daily for about a month, you can easily observe the dramatic change in the face to ensure the glowing skin. It is proven that the application of curd with honey with three teaspoon of oat meal and egg white twice in a week helps you to get a glowing skin.

I also came across tip that drinking good amount of water daily at periodical interval helps you to keep your skin smooth. Better avoid the synthetic creams and go in for the natural way of protecting your skin to remain presentable in front of others. Olive oil massaging is found to be the proven method of maintaining a healthy skin.
