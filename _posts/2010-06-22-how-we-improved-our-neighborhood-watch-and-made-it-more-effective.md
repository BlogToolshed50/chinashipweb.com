Thanks to Katy Hepp for the guest blog.

We decided to move to the country to enjoy a more private lifestyle and to get away from the busy city life. What we found was that living a semi private life had its drawbacks. We had no close neighbors and sometimes my husband would be gone until late in the evening. I really loved living away from city bustle but felt unsafe at times.

Because of the distance we have between neighbors we have a poor neighborhood watch program. Actually, we do not have a neighborhood support system in place. Although the neighbors look out for each other, sometimes it is hard to monitor all that may be going on. So it has become apparent that we needed to have a better way to make sure our home is secure and safe. I wanted, also, to feel a little more secure and safe when my husband was gone. There have been several break-ins and things stolen out of the garages or yards. We decided to install a adt alarm system. It made a big difference in the way I felt when I was alone. I felt a lot more secure and safe.
