This spring the NBA playoffs are in full force and I, for one, will surely watch every game I can on TV. This year, every elite team has made significant off-season and mid-season acquisitions to separate themselves even further from the rest. At the beginning of these playoffs there were legitimately only four or five teams that could actually be expected to compete for the title. Cleveland, Boston, San Antonio, and Orlando went out and spent some money on the best players available and staking the claim that anything less than a championship in 2010 will be a disappointment. Cleveland got Shaquille O&#8217;Neal only for playoff time when they figured they would inevitably face Dwight Howard and the Magic, who bounced them from the playoffs last year due to their size and strength. Boston picked up Rasheed Wallace for help inside come playoff time and the Spurs grabbed Richard Jefferson to help their aging &#8216;big three&#8217; in the playoffs after the lengthy regular season. So far, the playoffs have been a relative disappointment in the pairings, with most of the series ending in sweeps. Favorites such as Dallas and Cleveland have already been dropped, while Boston and Phoenix have made surprisingly deep playoff runs. Right now, it seems as though the NBA finals will see the two most successful franchises in NBA history, Boston and LA, square off for another banner.
