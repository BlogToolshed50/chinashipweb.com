High Blood Pressure called clinical Hyper tension is most prevalent in many people. The stress experienced both at home and office makes many of us prone to this deadly ailment. Some 50 years ago, medicine to tackle the high blood pressure was invented and the death rate due to this ailment was contained.

With the modern way of life, the incidence of hypertension is an increasing day by day and the non availability of timely assistance resulted in the death of many. It is estimated that about 15 million people are affected by high blood pressure in the UK alone. The statistics indicate that one in ten are unable to control this ailment through the medicine and succumb ultimately.

Recently a technique has been found out in the UK to avoid the high blood pressure by an operation that is concluded in just one hour. The operation involves placing tiny burns on a nerve responsible for high blood pressure in most of the people. This technique has been carried out in Britain for the first time and the result is found to be encouraging. This new procedure is called renal sympathetic -nerve ablation.

This technique is said to disrupt the signals that is emanated from the brain telling the kidneys to keep the blood pressure raised. This operation is expected to give the desired result within a period of three months. Mr. Anthony Henry, from Stratford is said to be the first person who had undergone this operation and shown positive result within two weeks time. Let us hope that many more such techniques are invented by the scientists to reduce the death rate due to high blood pressure.
