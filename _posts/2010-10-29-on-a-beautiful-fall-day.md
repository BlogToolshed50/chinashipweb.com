I appreciate the guest post, Jewel Rodgers

As the leaves begin to change, I know that fall is finally setting in. Apples, pumpkin pie, and spiced cider are among my favorite things of the season. Beautiful colors surround the neighborhood homes. Weekends in the fall are even more of a treat. Growing up, I was taught to support small business and local agriculture. As my family and I all crowd into the car on the way to the orchard, I remember to run back and set my home security alarm from .ALLHOMESECURITY.com. As we pull into the orchard, the smells are overwhelming! Cider doughnuts, fresh pumpkins, and shiny apples line the outdoor rows. And as if it wasn&#8217;t cute enough, the signs that depicted the prices of it all were shoddily hand-written. My family lines up and we all take pictures with our heads through the cutout plywood pictures. As we load back into the car with pecks of apples and a few nice-sized pumpkins, all that&#8217;s on my mind is the award-winning apple pies that my wife bakes. Immediately after arriving back at our home, dinner begins. Pumpkin bread, applesauce, and a large spiral ham cover the table. beautiful weather, delicious food, and my family. What else could I ever need on this perfect fall day?
