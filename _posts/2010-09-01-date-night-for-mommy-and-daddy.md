Guest written by our friend Mason Abbott

I have been married for 10 years and have three beautiful children with my husband. We are all very close and even have family fun night three times a month where we each take turns picking an activity. These times are very special to us, however, we do need time together without the kids. Once a month, me and my hubby get a babysitter to watch the kids while we get out of the house to see a movie. We make sure they have everything they need, all the numbers are posted, food is prepared, and the home security alarm is set. With our minds at ease becuase of our ADT monitoring, we get to enjoy the movie thoroughly. Since we live near Lynchburg, we will visit either the Regal 14 River Ridge Mall Theater, or the Cinemark Movies 10. They range dramatically in price with the first theater averaging $10 and the second around $2. However, we pretty much go where the movie is, price doesn&#8217;t matter since we only do this once a month. So, we pick out what we can both watch. We both love movies of all kinds, but the one type of movie that we tend to agree on every time is a good comedy. Not the subtle ones either, we like the edgy laugh out loud comedies that are for the mature crowd. This is a time when we get to relax and sit through an entire movie without getting up and missing plot points or jokes. It&#8217;s always great to have a good laugh with your spouse and enjoy the alone time!
