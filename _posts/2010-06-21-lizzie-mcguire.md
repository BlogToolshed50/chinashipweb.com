One of the best programs for young girls is &#8220;Lizzie McGuire.&#8221; I absolutely adore this show for giving my daughters a positive role model in the main character, Lizzie. This show prepares young girls for adolescence and making wise decisions. This show also thrives off of encouraging girls to have big dreams and goals in their lives. I love watching &#8220;Lizzie McGuire&#8221; on TV with my daughters. One time we used our direct tv order movie to watch the Lizzie McGuire movie on our home TV.

This show also teaches young girls how to be &#8220;okay&#8221; with being studious and serious about their goals in their lives. I think that is a very important value to teach young girls. All too often, girls end up setting low standards for themselves, because they feel it is weird to be studious or serious about life goals. &#8221; Lizzie McGuire&#8221; is a show that truly defied all of my expectations in a wonderful way. I am grateful for this show and how it has taught my daughters that anything in life is truly possible when one has big dreams and high standards.

‚ÄùLizzie McGuire&#8221; is also a show that teaches girls there is more to life than fitting in or trying to be the most popular. The show teaches girls how to think independently, rather than get their views from peers around them or the media. I highly recommend &#8220;Lizzie McGuire&#8221; for girls of all ages.
