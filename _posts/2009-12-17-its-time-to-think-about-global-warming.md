Have you ever heard of the Hyper sensitive sea creatures? Yes indeed, they are found to be more sensitive to the global warming than the other living creatures elsewhere in the planet. It is quite interesting to know that even a two degree rise in the temperature at the Antarctica region can make the antarctic spider, limpets the sea urchins to get affected greatly due to the non functioning of their vital organs.

The symptom is observed in the case of exotic animals around Antarctica when the temperature has risen by one degree Celsius over a period of past 50 years. The animals are so temperature sensitive and the ecosystem is at a higher risk as confirmed from the study of Simon Morley, a marine biologist at the British Antarctic Survey at Rithera. It is amazing to know that the Coral reefs can also suffer a heavy damage even if there is slight rise in the temperature.

I am rather worried over the prediction by UN Climate Panel that the air temperature may rise between 1.8 degree to four degree Celsius this century due to the excess greenhouse gas emission. It is also recorded that in warmer waters, the ability of the Clams and limpets is lost to bring them back to the right position if they land upside down. This ability is the most needed one if they want thrive in Antarctica area.

Many of the scientists working on the impact of the global warming on the sea creatures wonder whether they will be able to with stand the increasing atmospheric temperature. As the sensible human being, it is our first for most duty to ensure that we are not contributing to that damage in the future.
