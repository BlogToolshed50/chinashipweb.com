When the need of the hour is to increase the food production every developing county is making its own strategy to get the desired result. Recently I read the news that the farmers are now informed about the latest agricultural practices over mobile phone in few countries. In this modern world it is imperative that the technology is used by everyone and the dissemination of the same is made easy. When the majority of the population in the globe is now using mobile in their day to day life it is being well-thought by a company by name HANYGO to venture into this service.

The farming is now undertaken by the well educated person also and they need timely information on the various improved agricultural practices. Here, comes the role of mobile phones as stated above. Farmers can ask for clarification on agricultural practices which will be answered through the mobile. Even they are contemplating the dissemination of information about the weather changes periodically by sending the SMS to the farmers so that they can plan their operations for the succeeding period.

In a country like India and China where in the majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, this will go a long way to achieve the desired result. The nation can ensure better food security as well
