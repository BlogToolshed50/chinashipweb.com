If you want to dramatically increase creativity, develop creative habits of mind. Watch a good comedian and you&#8217;ll see that she has trained her mind to look for the &#8220;different angle&#8221; on everyday things. You can train your mind to do the same. Circle Of Information

Challenge assumptions, for example, until it becomes habit. Looking for ways to get customers into your store? Stop and say, &#8220;Do I really need more customers?&#8221; The question suggests other creative solutions, like finding ways to make more money off existing customers, or ways to cut expenses. These may lead to more profitable ideas. Challenge assumptions to increase the creativity of your solutions.

As you drive to work, randomly choose anything around you and ask how it may be connected to whatever problem you are working on. A helicopter overhead might make you think about a way to track where the car goes when you loan it to your kids. A palm tree may lead to a new design for patio umbrellas.

The above techniques are called &#8220;Assumption Challenging&#8221; and &#8220;Random Presentation,&#8221; and are two classic creative problem solving techniques. There are dozens more. Train your brain to habitually use these, and provide it with a little encouragement, and you really can increase your creativity.
