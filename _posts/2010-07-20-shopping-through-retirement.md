It’s no coincidence that I moved into a retirement community just a few minutes away from a huge retail outlet center. I’ve shopped quite a bit during the first part of my life and I don’t plan on slacking off on it during retirement.

Last weekend I went in the GAP Outlet where I found a great little hat for my 3-year-old granddaughter. I was ready to pay and approached the cash register where the cashier rang up the hat. She told me the total and I had to ask her to repeat herself. She told me again and I still had to ask her to repeat herself. Then she pointed to the keypad where you can enter in your PIN when you use a debit card and I saw the total. It was a little embarrassing having to ask her to repeat herself, but I’m just glad that screen was there so I could refer to it.

My friend Joyce who was with me suggested that I investigate getting some digital hearing aids. I thought those sounded kind of expensive so I looked up hearing devices and miracle ear in Texas but realized that they were pretty affordable.

I’m getting equipped with one this week and look forward to testing it out at the outlets.
