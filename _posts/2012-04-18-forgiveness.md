One of the most debated subjects around the world is forgiveness. Somebody does something wrong, either against an individual, or against the society. To forgive means to pardon the accused with no resentment left. If forgiveness is complete, the act of offense is totally forgotten, as if it never took place.

To talk about forgiveness is easy, and to forgive is difficult. Many a times it becomes impossible for some of us. For example if I am a mother. A criminal kidnaps my child and then slowly kills my child in my presence to derive sadistic pleasure, how will I feel? What about the cries of pain of my dying child? Will my mind forget them? What of the helplessness that I felt? What about the expectation with which my child looked at me and felt sure that mother would do something to save him/her? What of the helplessness I felt? What about the memories of bringing up my child? What about the dreams that I had? What about the pain and torture my child underwent while dying?

My nightmares will haunt me forever. Anything that belonged to my child will bring the memories of death back like a wave. My sadness will overwhelm me forever and my silent fury against my own weakness will kill me. Can I ever forgive that man? Can I ever forget that act after pardoning him? Will you?

This is the most difficult part of forgiveness. It becomes impossible to forgive. The scars go so deep that even after the man is sentenced for the crime, the mother will never feel complete. No amount of punishment given to that man will ever bring the child back. No clock will ever turn back. The pain that the child underwent cannot be taken away at all. I am doomed to live in misery forever unless I forgive. But I cannot forgive. I know that many people will come and ask me to forgive.
