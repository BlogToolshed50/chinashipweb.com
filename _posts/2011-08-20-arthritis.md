Arthritis is an ailment caused due to the ageing process. When the joint surfaces become damaged it results in the painful osteoarthritis at the knee joints. Intramuscular injections are given with painkillers at times to reduce the pain. Modern medicine offers sophisticated surgery to replace the knee joints that are damaged beyond healing. The joints also become inflamed as a symptom to show the occurrence of this autoimmune disease. Many athletes damage their knee joints owing to excess use of the parts as a part of their profession.
