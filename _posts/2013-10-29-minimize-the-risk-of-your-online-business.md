In an effort to increase their income, many people start a part-time business. Some of them do something they are good at (like fixing cars), others own a brick and mortar business (such as a franchise), while others join a multi-level marketing program. Have you considered a website? Here are some convincing reasons why you should start an online business.

1. Low Investment Requirement

If you look around the internet, you can register a domain name for as little as $0.99. That means that you could potentially start an online business for less than one dollar. If you look go by the statistics that state that nine out of ten businesses fail in the first year, it would cost just ten dollars to get one to work.

2. Global Customer Base

If you start up a garage, you can only offer services to those in your community. You are not able to fix my car up here in Canada if you live in Texas.

With the internet, you now have the opportunity to reach a global audience – your office can be located in England, but you can sell your product in China. This means that you are not limited by regional demand; rather you should be able to find a lucrative market for your type of product.

3. Collect Money while you Sleep

A traditional business is usually open a limited amount of time per day. A website is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. You can be in the office and the website can be making money. You can be at the supermarket and make money. Even while you are sleeping the website can be making you money.

4. Flexible Hours

Traditional businesses usually have fixed hours and your customers expect you to be there during these times. You can complete orders from your website over the lunch hour, after supper or even at three in the morning. This can free you up to spend time with your family, go to your children’s recitals, and do those things you love to do during the day. This can be very empowering – you have control over your life instead of someone telling you when to work.

5. No need to sell product

Unlike a traditional store where you would sell a product or offer a service, you can make money online without selling anything. In fact, just by sharing your knowledge and experience, you can make some easy money.

6. Similar needs

Have you ever needed a service or product that you couldn’t find? Or needed some critical information that no one seems to have? Create a website that addresses that need – chances are that you are not the only one that is in need of that service or information. You took the time to find out about it, why not make some money from it?

Next time you consider starting a business, give a website a try. Not only do you require little investment capital, but you can reach a broad audience, and even pick your own work hours – what more could you ask for.
