It is that time of year. I get up early and get the kids ready to go back to school shopping. Before leaving the house though, I set my adt home security alarm so I know we will all be safe when we get home.

Shopping can be fun and exciting but it can also be tiresome and tough. Especially when it is back to school time. I enjoy the shopping involved with back to school items.

The first place I like to go is the dollar store. They have tons of back to school items all at dollar store prices. Paper, pencils, glue, pencil holders, and backpacks are all just a few of the things I like to get there. Then it is off to Wal-Mart for some cool clothes that the kids all want. Wal-Mart has good clothes at prices I know I can afford. Usually, if I cannot find all the clothes they need after being here for a couple of hours, I will head on over to Kohl&#8217;s. They always have beautiful clothes with discounts all over the store. Some items you can even get at 75% off. Kohl&#8217;s also has shoes for the entire family with back to school discounts.

The kids will be happy and I will be thrilled about all the money I just saved this time of year.
