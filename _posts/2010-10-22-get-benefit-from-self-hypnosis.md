In the beginning of 20th century, Émile Coué had his take on self hypnosis as well. Many say that he is an influential figures when it comes to the subsequent development of the practice. He came up with the theory on &#8220;conscious autosuggestion&#8221; which eventually became renowned around the world for being an effective self-help system. His detachment from the concept of the usual &#8220;hypnosis&#8221; were passed to his followers like as Charles Baudouin who is one of the pioneers of modern hypnotherapists. 

German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz also became a well known figure in the field of hypnosis when he developed &#8220;autogenic training&#8221;. This specific training is designed for relaxation and was made to public awareness when it was first published way back in the year 1932. The influence of Schultz in this approach was fellow German hypnotist named Oskar Vogt. 

Hypnotherapist and early behavior therapist Andrew Salter also contributed a lot in self hypnosis when he published his first major academic journal on self-hypnosis that talked about the three techniques of autohypnosis in 1841involving &#8220;autohypnosis by post-hypnotic suggestion&#8221;, &#8220;autohypnosis by memorised trance instructions,&#8221; and &#8220;fractional autohypnosis&#8221;.
