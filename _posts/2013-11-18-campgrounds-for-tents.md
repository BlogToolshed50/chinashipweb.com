Remember the good-old days when heading out through the woods was safe? You could take along your families and/or friends, build a fire, pop up a few tents, roast some marshmallows and tell spooky stories just for kicks. Yep, those were the days. Unfortunately Jason Voorhees had to come along and ruin everything. Uh, wait a minute. Never mind. It actually wasn&#8217;t Jason at all. It was the criminal content of our society that ruined this ritual. Now days it&#8217;s plain and simply NOT prudent to camp out where you please. Only a fool would set up camp in some random neck of the woods. Serial killers and psychopaths search for people like this. They&#8217;re easy targets. These days you have to seek out tent campgrounds . It&#8217;s the only way to get the nature experience in a safe fashion.

There&#8217;s always your own property. If you live on a nice piece of land with a healthy wooded area, consider yourself blessed. You are one of the few who have no need for tent campgrounds. I used to camp out on my own property as a kid all the time. We had 15 acres of mostly woods and it was a blast. Not once did I ever encounter a stranger on our land. It was ideal back then. My brothers and I could pop up a tent deep in our woods and hang out there all weekend. We became masters at building fires with flint and steel, purifying water, and dealing with small portions of food. Hey, it was a blast! But, now that I&#8217;m an adult and live in a suburb, I don&#8217;t exactly have a personal place to take my daughter camping. I have to research local tent campgrounds like KOA. These are the common places that folks with tents and campers go to recapture that exciting outdoor experience, and do so the safe way. Criminals have to interest in tent campgrounds loaded with masses of people.

Don&#8217;t miss out on the outdoor experience! Take your children and family camping at least once in your life. This is a fun outdoor activity that everyone should be able to enjoy. Check out your local listings for tent campgrounds nearby. Just make sure you have all the necessary supplies before heading off to the campsite.

When you want to buy a good tent you must first decide what you want to use the tent for. If your going up into the mountains camping then you need something that is going to stand up in bad weather, but if you are just camping in the local woods for a night in summer then a cheaper tent might do the job just fine.
