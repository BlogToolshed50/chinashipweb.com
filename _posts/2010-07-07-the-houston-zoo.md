Thanks to my friend Pam Guerllio for the post

When you have a family, there might seem to be a shortage of things you can do outdoors. The Houston Zoo is one of the best places to go just before the hot summer sun begins to swelter. We took our two daughters to the Houston Zoo last month and got to see and experience all sorts of interesting things. We gathered up all of our snacks and lunch stuff so that we could picnic in the park and set the ADT home security alarm before we left the house.

The zoo is a great place to take kids no matter what city you’re in. The Houston Zoo posts feedings and talks with the animal handlers on their website so you can plan ahead to see things like the snake feeding. We got there early, but didn’t manage to make it to the snake feeding. There was a talk with the seal keeper and the elephant keeper that we got to hear, however, and the kids were able to get some questions answered.

There are also little cafes around the entire zoo, in case you get hungry; they have everything from snow cones to hotdogs, but are (as always) a little pricey. We brought out food to picnic in Hermann Park nearby. You can get a stamp before you leave the zoo so that you may return later that day. The zoo staff was always ready to answer questions or direct us to a restroom we’ll return for another visit soon.
