Everybody wants more traffic, and not just any old traffic – targeted traffic. Streams of pre-qualified visitors who are genuinely interested in your website and product are every smart webmaster’s dream.

If you’re mainly interested in your hit counter, you can sign up with any old auto-surf program and you’ll soon be happy. However, if quality counts for you, then here are 5 methods of getting genuine, interested and ready to buy visitors to your site:

1. Testimonials.
  
2. Writing Articles.
  
3. Forums.
  
4. Press Releases.
  
5. Your Newsletter.

Testimonials
  
Sometimes it really is better to give than receive. Internet marketers are always on the lookout for testimonials – it lends them credibility. The next time you use a product or service that you genuinely like send the supplier a testimonial. Include a link to your website and, if they use your testimonial, they will almost certainly include the link – so that their customers can verify that you’re a real person.

Depending on the product and the type of website that you have, you could even host a review on your site. You would be highly likely to get a link using this method. You will get traffic using this method and, since the supplier of the product is likely to be promoting his site quite extensively, you could get a very high quality back link &#8211; which will help your search engine rankings as well.

Only endorse products that you are genuinely happy with. Remember, your name will be associated with it, so make sure it’s a good one.

Writing Articles
  
This is a great way to promote both yourself and your site. All you have to do is submit articles on your chosen topic to one or more of the free article banks available and content hungry webmasters will use your work on their sites and in their newsletters. It&#8217;s amazing how quickly these can be distributed around the internet.

Put a link to your site in your signature file, along with a few words of explanation on the content and purpose of your site. The visitors that you get in this manner have already read your work and know about your site – so they are highly targeted.
