I&#8217;m glad to say that school started last week, finally we are all able to get some sleep. Where we live, my kid&#8217;s school sports practices always start before classes do. And for some reason even though once school starts practices are after school, pre-school start they are always very early in the morning. This has been the first week we have been able to sleep past five o-clock for a month.

My boy had his first football game last Friday. I almost didn&#8217;t make it. We had some plumbing issues and I was waiting for the guy to finish up after he arrived three hours late. He seemed completely unmoved at the importance of junior high football, and game start times. On top of that, Lil Sis&#8217; was in a tither about what to wear to the game. There would be Junior high boys there and apparently this first football game is considered a kind of coming out for the 6th grade girls.

Anyway, the plumber finished in a nick of time, Lil Sis settled on a pink sweater, and I set the home security provider near Boston and got out the door just in time to get sat down, only to stand up, for the kick off.

My Little Man made me proud.
