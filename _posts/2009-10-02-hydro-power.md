Many countries are blessed with adequate water resources which helps them to produce hydro power.  Electricity produced from hydro power station is cheap when compared to other sources. Many reservoirs built in various countries help in producing this hydro power apart from storing water for the irrigation purpose.  It up to the Governments to go in for more numbers of reservoirs to enhance the production of hydro power.
