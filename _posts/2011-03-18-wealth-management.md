Wealth Management is the job undertaken by the banks and the financial institution all over the world. They manage the wealth of the people who are away from the place where the assets are situated. The assets falling under this category may be both movable and immovable. The movable assets like bank investment and shares are also managed by the trustees on behalf of the owner. The custodian of the wealth is paid with the service charges to manage the wealth for the direction of the owner. Every financial institution is having a separate department to manage such wealth.
