To be a real success in your life and your business you must become a leader. This doesn&#8217;t mean pretending to be someone else, or changing your core values, it&#8217;s just about being more confident in who you are. It&#8217;s about applying a very simple 5 step process, and all you have to do is keep applying it until your view of yourself and others&#8217; perception of you begins to shift.

1. Establish a Vision
  
Every great leader in anything has a vision. It&#8217;s a strong vision that they would not give up for anything. A leader knows exactly where they are going and go after it with determination and a knowing that it is their only possible outcome. Others are magnetized to the leader as they can see that this is someone who knows where they are going. This is the absolute basis upon which all leadership is built. Without this, you can never lead because you will not be going anywhere.

2. Learn and Apply a Good System
  
People do not attain major changes in their lives without applying a good system effectively and consistently. If you want to change your mindset you follow laid out exercises and do them everyday. These are simply a system to achieve a specific result. If you want to get from point A to point B, the shortest route is a straight line. A definite and effective system will move you from A to B much faster than if you continually change directions.

3. Add Value
  
Without added value you cannot offer others anything. If you don&#8217;t have extra knowledge, resources, and capabilities to help you get where you are going, no one will need to join you. They will turn to someone who does have extra knowledge and information to offer. Adding value is simple: education. Learn whatever you can get your hands on and never think you&#8217;re done. To be an effective leader you must always be learning, keeping up to date, and understanding that you never have all the answers.

4. Give Your Value Away
  
The secret to true leadership is that your value is not decreased, but increased when you give it away to others. Every time you give away good quality information without looking for something in return you become more of a leader in the eyes of those around you. You have the confidence to know that there is an abundance of wealth, information, prospects, etc out there and that helping others will only help you.

5. Expect Leadership from Your Followers
  
The principal applies to everyone, your followers will need to become leaders themselves to achieve the success they are seeking. So point them in the right direction, help them get educated themselves, give them the resources and tools that helped you, then let them find their own path. Expect them to become their own leader with their own vision.

This process happens organically for many people, but if you feel like a follower take these simple steps to change your own image and become a leader.
