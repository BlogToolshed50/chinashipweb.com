Look, its obvious isn&#8217;t? Without a ton of traffic to your site you aren&#8217;t going to get the amount of sales or any leads you hope for.

The number one question I receive from my clients who use our webmaster tools is &#8220;How do I get more traffic to my site?&#8221; I&#8217;m about to let you know some easy ways to get visitors flocking to your site starting today. Lets look at some obvious but often overlooked tips:

1. Get a Killer Domain Name.

People will never forget a catchy domain name. Be sure to choose a short and easy to remember domain name that is appropriate to your business and has a nice ring to it. Remember the domain name is your online brand.

2. Upload Fresh and useful content.

These days people are banner blind. They want more than ads. Give them information they can&#8217;t find anywhere else, and give it to them for free. Give them the content they want and need. If you do don&#8217;t know what it is, ask them.

3. Get your site seen by the Search Engines.

Search engines bring more than 75% of traffic to most web sites. You can submit your site all day long but the best way to get seen is to get links on quality relevant sites. The search engines will find you within a few days. You can seek out both one way links from other sites and also reciprocal link exchanges with other webmasters. Just stay away from those nasty link farms!

4. Pay For Top Spots.

The quickest way to get website traffic without trying too hard is to pay for it. These advertisements would be posted on prime locations or banners of websites.

Banners are cheap and are great for branding, through don&#8217;t expect a ton of click through. Popular websites like leading newspapers and search engines would provide immediate recognition and visibility to their customers. If you have the cash, spend it. Many don&#8217;t or won&#8217;t.

5. Form a Community.

Start a message board, email group, or even a chat forum. Actively participate in these groups by posting answers to other peopleâ€™s questions. Be visible and always include your signature at the end of your postings. The best thing about these types of sites is that people come back again and again. Check your hosting account to see if you have free forum software included. I bet you do.

6. Start Your Own Mailing List.

It is the best way to keep in touch with your prospects and your customers. Build a relationship with your list. Your email list can make your site a success again and again. The best customer is an existing customer.

7. Start an E-Zine for Your Website.

An E-zine is an extension of your site, but this will highlight new information and features of your site. People will be reminded of your website as they read each issue.

If they find they issue interesting or worth sharing, they can easily and instantly pass this on to the people within their network. Give them a freebie for signing up.

8. Submit Articles.

Write your own article just like this one and submit it to e-zines, websites and magazines that accept article submissions. Be sure to include your business and contact information and website address in the resource box.

9. Exchange Ads with other Website.

Create ads that will promote your business and website. Submit this to e-zines or other websites in exchange for free ad space in your own electronic publication. Your presence on other sites is very important in getting the increased traffic that you want. This is usually facilitated with either simple links or flashy banners.

10. Always Update Your Website.

Your website should always be up and running and full of fresh content. It is to your advantage if you maintain your website with new articles and updated features. If your visitors always find what they want and need, they will definitely be coming back again. Additionally, search engine spiders love a site with changing content!

Now go back to the top and read through this list again. You may think you know this information already, but I wonder how many of you have actually taken action on it.

Also don&#8217;t be discouraged if you don&#8217;t see amazing result straight away. I guarantee working on these strategies a little bit each day will bring some serious traffic in the weeks and months ahead.
