It is a common argument that ‘a fit worker is productive worker’. It is becoming a universal realization that demands modern organizational practice has increased chances of stress breakthrough among employees and it’s becoming crucial for managers to identify sources and formulate strategies to reduce it (Papers4you.com, 2006).

It is argued that stress can be good as well as bad however bad stress is what causes adverse effects in employee’s productivity. Bad stress is ‘a mismatch between a person’s self-image, their attributes and talents and organizational environment they work in’. Moreover ‘burn out’ is taken as the extreme form of stress that is a stress syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment.

Bad stress has become such a serious aspect that in Japan, stress is perceived as a destructive national dilemma and issue. In order to reduce bad stress it is important to know the reasons behind it. Just imagine an example where a middle manager and publication officer working in a publication company. She is responsible for the regular publication of two monthly journals, research for yearly statistical reports as well management of short term contracted staff. Such huge workload resulted in forgetfulness, irritability, lower productivity, postponed deadlines and spread of such melancholy across the organization So sources of bad stress can be climate, change, rules, work pace management style, work group characteristics and many other reasons. Similarly bad stress in workplace can be caused by long hours working, repetitive and distasteful tasks, isolation, job hazards, poor public image of organization, lack of job security or any conflicting demands

Hence, there is no second argument on the fact that bad stress can be detrimental for organizational progress and employee’s productivity that however can be reduced and managed by identifying sources and effective policy making.
