Thanks to guest blogger Rachel Dragan for the post.

I really was starting to get bored with Tampa, so I decided to get out of town for good. I figured that D.C. would be cool because I would have to move far to get away from the drama that was in Tampa. I really didn&#8217;t have a lot of money to move with, so it was one of my only realistic options. After meeting this land lady named Gretchen, we hit it off completely. In the two days that I knew her before getting the apartment from her, she had transformed herself into a virtual family member of mine. She was nice enough to introduce me to her grandson who was able to get me signed up to the same DC area home security companies that Gretchen was with. I wasn&#8217;t sure why everybody was so willing to assist me in my transition, but they did. I was pointed in the right way for getting a moving truck that I didn&#8217;t have to pay mileage rates on, which was awesome. That made me save at least $75 or so. even though D.C. is really a big tourist attracting city, it is kind of cool. We always have work available because of them and we get to meet a lot of interesting people that are just passing through for a good family weekend vacation. I love it here!
