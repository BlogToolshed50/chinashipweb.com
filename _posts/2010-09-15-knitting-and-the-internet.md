There is no better thing for me to do then to sit around and create wonderful works of art with knitting. Knitting allows me to not only make money at my business online, but to also give gifts that are homemade to family and friends. This is the reason that knitting is such an important thing to me, transcending a mere hobby. It has also helped me to relieve a great amount of stress in different situations in my life.

There were times when I was forced to not only go and shop at different places around the city to get my materials, but sometimes I couldn&#8217;t find certain things. I then had to go and search through mail order catalogs for objects I needed such as yarn and special needles. This took so much time and caused me a great deal of frustration. I ended up almost giving up knitting when I moved to Wasilla, because there were no supply stores near me.

When I realized that I could use the satellite internet I had with my DIRECTTV internet combo to simply shop online at various places from the comfort of my own home and be able to buy single items I needed, instead of bulk, it opened up new doors of productivity for me and now my online business thrives and I even sell from my house on the internet.
