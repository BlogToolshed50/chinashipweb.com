As an art graduate I had my own reservation towards the utility of the various equations and ratios of mathematics in the real life. I was under the staunch impression that these are having a limited usage and non one need to be so genius to learn this unwanted subject. A recent article in a news paper completely changed my perception on this subject and I was ashamed about my own ignorance on the excellent and vital contribution of mathematics to take care of our day to day requirement.

I was astonished to know that the traffic signals are run on algorithm which determines when the light will switch to red and green.It is amazing to realize their role in helping the human being to run the modern life. Do you know that ,the discount on our loyalty card is the result of deep data analysis ?.If you are booking a low cost flight, an algorithm will determine how much the ticket is groping to cost based on the supply and demand at that particular point of time.You will equally surprised to know that the weather forecast on Tv and the predictions done by the concerned department is fine tuned by algorithm.

The super market, you visit every day is the hot bed of algorithms application.In fact ,major parts of the modern life is secretly underpinned by complex algorithms.Algorithms are said to be like the computer programs or flow charts with a sequence of steps that examines what is happening and comes to a conclusion.Thus i could understand that algorithms have lot of potential application in so many field directly related with our modern life and we should try to understand itâ€™s role fully.
