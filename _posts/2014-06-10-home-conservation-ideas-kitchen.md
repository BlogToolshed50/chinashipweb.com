Consider these 6 no cost home energy saving tips and conservation ideas for your kitchen. I think we all can agree that the kitchen is one of the most visited rooms through out any home. Whether it&#8217;s the task of preparing food, grabbing a quick snack or the inviting smells from a delicious dish or roast; the kitchen is unavoidable.

There&#8217;s no wonder most of the activities performed in the kitchen are also some of the biggest sources of household energy. Wow just thinking about the kitchen is working my appetite, here are 6 cost free energy saving tips and conservation ideas for your kitchen.

1: Check your refrigerators temperature settings. The recommended temperature setting for fresh foods is about 38 degrees and for frozen foods it&#8217;s about 0 degrees.

2: Check the door latch and seals on your refrigerator. If the latch needs adjusting then grab a wrench and get to work. Replacing old adhesive seals will also provide the original air tight fit and seal.

3: Don&#8217;t forget to defrost your freezer. Frost build up is not only unsightly, it&#8217;s inefficient. Don&#8217;t allow the freezers frost to build up more than one quarter of an inch.

4: Use a microwave or a pressure cooker or an electric plug in grill when possible. A conventional oven uses considerably more natural gas or electricity than electric grills, pressure cooker and microwaves.

5: Turn off the oven about 5 to 10 minutes before the recommended cooking time. If the temperature setting is 325 degrees or even higher, the left over heat will be sufficient enough to last the remainder 5 to 10 minutes and finish off your roast. I&#8217;m getting hungry again.

6: Periodically clean your oven range tops and reflectors. This ensures that the range heat will be reflected more effectively and efficiently.
