My favorite tv show on a premium channel is True Blood from HBO. There is never a dull moment on the show and it keeps me glued to the tv every Sunday night. I live in a rural area and am very thankful that I got my tv from tvbydirect.com.

My favorite character is Sookie Stackhouse. The first season started with her falling for a vampire named Bill Compton. As it has evolved over the last two seasons, so has their relationship. One of them is always in some sort of trouble. They have been chased by werewolves, vampire hunters, shape shifters, and fang bangers in the past seasons.

Another interesting character is Sam Merlott, who is a shape shifter. He owns the local bar and restaurant in the town of Bon Temps where the show takes place. He is Sookies employer and close confidant. He has a greater role in the third season. He is looking for his family and find out why he is the way that he is.

If you are into fang banging, blood and gore and vampires then this is a great show for you. You should check it out on HBO!
