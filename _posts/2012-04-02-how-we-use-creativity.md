One of the most obvious uses of creativity is&#8230;

Using Creativity at Work

I want to talk not just about how we \*do\* use our creativity at work, but about how we \*can\* and perhaps \*should\* use it.

Self-promotion is a great use of creativity, and one that many people are afraid of without even really knowing what it is or how to use it.

One way to use your creativity effectively at work is to demonstrate your creativity and effectiveness. If your boss asks for a report on a particular subject, maybe you can use your creative flair for charts to make the numbers more understandable. If you&#8217;re asked to lead a meeting, you can show off your public speaking skills.

The best way to self-promote is to constantly be doing your best to make everyone around you look good, because when you&#8217;re at your most effective, you make everyone else&#8217;s work easier. And using your particular creative skills is a great way to accomplish this.

Another really important use of creativity at work is in communication. Even the most seemingly mundane conversations require creativity in the form of listening, interpreting the other person&#8217;s meaning, and offering the correct response to serve the purpose of the conversation.

There are many uses of creativity on the job, but these are two I think most people can really put to use today, in their own lives, and thus the two I want to focus on.

Creativity in Relationships

Have you ever noticed how some relationships, including friendships, get old and stale after a while? You just get bored. You don&#8217;t have anything to talk about.

Creativity is crucial in relationships, not just in communication, which is vital, but also in terms of the relationship itself.

I have a friend I go to lunch with sometimes. Generally we go to one of the same four or five places, and that&#8217;s comfortable for us. We like the food, the restaurants are quiet enough for us to talk, and they&#8217;re close.

But occasionally we do something different, just for fun. And we enjoy it because it is different.

Similarly, I sometimes call this friend with an anecdote or story I&#8217;ve come across. It&#8217;s not just the same old, &#8220;How are you, how are the kids&#8221; conversation. I&#8217;ll tell her about a book I&#8217;m reading or invite her to visit a web site I&#8217;ve found.

Effective relationships are not static. And keeping them from being static requires creativity.

I&#8217;ve mostly concentrated, to this point, on how you can use creativity in external settings &#8211; at work and in relationships. Now I want to change course a little bit and talk about how we use creativity in our lives, in interpersonal ways. I think there are a lot of ways creativity contributes to our lives, and this series, as long as it is, can&#8217;t cover them all. My goal is mainly to get you thinking about creativity and its roles in our lives.
