I am a big fan of beads and necklaces that are wonderfully put together with [toho](http://www.beadaholique.com/c-62686-toho-beads.aspx) beads. Toho are one of the very best and most popular beads that are made in Japan and allow for making wonderful patterns using multiple pass stringing techniques. I do like pearls, wood and fabric beads for my work. Some of the things that you cannot do with normal beads can be worked out with toho beads. Do give it a try if you want to expand your horizon on your work of art.
