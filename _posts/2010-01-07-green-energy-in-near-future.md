On the other day when I was taking my morning walk on the seaside, I was enjoying the early morning tides in the sea and wondering about the force they emanate. It struck to me that human being should use this God given energy to produce the clean energy without any pollution. Back home I stumbled upon an article that precisely expressed my own views and I was too happy to note that a company by name Cornige Corp., in Australia is venturing into this area of power generation.

It is so nice to read the information that they are planning to produce as much as 50 Mega Watts of power from the wave by operating a turbine. The cost to produce the 50 MW comes to around USD 153 million to USD 257 million. The clean energy so produced will be able to meet out the electricity requirement of a moderate town. It was indeed a pleasant surprise to read the news and I was really happy that the human kind is heading towards a better day in the matter of using natural resources and renewable energy sources. When there is limitation for the wind energy, the power from waves is an everlasting and never ending renewable source for the humans.

It is quite interesting to know that as much as 500000 MW of electricity can be produced in Australia by using the wave energy. In my considered opinion, if the entire world uses this source, our dependence on the hydrocarbon will drastically come down. We will be certainly leaving a less polluted atmosphere to the generation to come for a hale and healthy life. Recently Britain also announced their intention to go in for this clean source of energy without any pollution.
