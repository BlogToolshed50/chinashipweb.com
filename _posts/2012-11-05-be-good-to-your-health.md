Are your working to much?
  
You could be one of 50 million Americans taking work related health risks. This is especially true for solo entrepreneurs, who must wear many hats.

Friends say you look great! And you feel like superman. But how healthy are you really?

Hidden risks such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and prostrate cancer can occur without warnings. Research reports state; &#8220;those who feel health will most likely NOT get regular doctor checkups.&#8221; Your health is akin to your car, neglect oil changes or tune ups and you\`re hitch hiking. Self-health maintenance, mind and spirit are all wellness advantages. So plan that much-needed vacation. You deserve a break today.
