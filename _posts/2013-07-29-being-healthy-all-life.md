When you grow old and retire after a longer official life you can easily become prey to various ailments. The best way to reduce such incidence is to go in for periodical exercise to keep your health in pink. A morning walk is the conventional and well proven method of maintaining your health.In case your are a busy executive and not able to find the requisite time to go for the walk and do some exercise outdoor , the best way is to do it indoor systematically.

I came across the the “Pilates ” form of exercise recently in an article which is found to be fitting to the expectation of many. This technique is named after Mr.Joseph H Pilates whose technique focuses on stabilizing the core strength of the body by proper exercise.Strengthening of the muscles of core area of the body like hips, abs and back helps to further protects the spine, improves the abdominal strength and enhances the body alignment. Pilates stipulates various principles like doing the exercise with correct breathing technique coupled with proper movement with control.

From my own experience I could find out Pilate as the unique way of doing physical exercise in a slow and relaxed manner.It is very helpful to stretch your body while strengthening at the same time which you can not enjoy in the normal exercise.I came to know that even medical professionals and physiotherapists are endorsing this technique as the suitable method to go ahead in keeping you fit in the future.It is advisable that you go for doing such exercise under the proper guidance of a trained person.
