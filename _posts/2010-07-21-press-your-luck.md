Thanks to Ricardo Mullins

Press Your Luck is a game show that was on a long time ago. It doesn&#8217;t have new shows anymore, but I can still find it on The Gameshow Network direct tv deals in California. I am so happy to be able to watch this show. This show has three contestants at a time. They are all competing for cash and prizes. They answer questions and depending on how good they do get a certain amount of spins. They hit a button that selects which prize they win for each turn. Sometimes they end up with a a Whammy. These are funny. They make them lose all of their money, but they also do cute things. They can dump grass or cotton on their head sometimes. They are a little cartoon character that goes across the screen doing something funny. The person at the end of this show with the most money will win everything that they won during the game. The other players do not get to take home any of their prizes. I would have loved to go on this game show!
