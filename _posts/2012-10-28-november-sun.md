I don&#8217;t think we can live a truly fulfilled life unless we notice and appreciate the beauty of simple things. As children we want to grow up so fast, and then it takes a lifetime to relearn to see the world through the child&#8217;s eye. I think that children are our best teachers. It is great to watch them discover the world. As they do that with their fresh, uncontaminated minds, they see things we have forgotten they even existed.

The hard part for us is to clear our minds from the baggage we carry over the years of our adulthood. There are ways to do that though, and then the whole new world opens up. Priorities change, relationships deepen, and time becomes of different value. Appreciating simple things brings the entire new perspective on life. November Sun is my little exercise to attempt to look at the world through the child&#8217;s eye.

NOVEMBER SUN

When frosty wind blew not so strong,
  
It took the leaves in graceful glide.
  
They lingered just a bit too long,
  
Like they were hoping we forgot.

Though raking them was quite a drag,
  
I missed them waving from the trees.
  
But then, I thought, November sun
  
Has more of Mother Earth to see.

I picked one up, so big and bright;
  
It told me: &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry over me.
  
I will be back with all my pals,
  
I&#8217;ll come next year, I guarantee&#8221;.

Relieved a bit and quite surprised,
  
Kept raking them without much fun.
  
When I looked up there was the prizeâ€¦
  
They did unveil November sun.
