I appreciate the guest post, Emerson Moses

Between working a full time job and coaching a young girls dance team, finding the time to plan a wedding was difficult. Since I wasn&#8217;t able to meet with planners, florists and caterers, I relied heavily on satellite internet. Logging on with my satellite internet, I would be able to find information about all different aspects of my wedding. I found my dress, bridesmaids dresses and miniature bride and groom outfits on the internet and was able to find local places to order them through.

There were also many great wedding blogs available for me to gather inspiration for my big day. By looking through these blogs I found some great ideas for different centerpieces, food choices and shower ideas. I even joined a few different groups of other women planning their wedding. This was a great way for me to get to talk to other women going through the same thing. The internet was also really helpful in me sharing my plans with my friends and family across the country. I was able to send them links to all my ideas , which made them feel included in the entire process. With my busy schedule, the internet was my saving grace at times.
