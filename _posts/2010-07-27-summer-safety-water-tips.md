Thanks for the guest post by Dave Myers

Safety tips are about a dime a dozen. There isn&#8217;t an article that does not mention securitychoice.com home security alarms, and you will be hard pressed to find safety advice that does not include defensive techniques. However, there is a lot more to being safe then alarms and techniques.

One thing that is important is to keep your children safe during the summertime. One of the favorite summer sports is swimming. Make sure that your child brushes up on the safety rules for the swimming pool. It is essential that they understand not to run around the pool. It is a wet area, and the child could slip and injure himself.

In addition to this, review what needs to be done if an emergency occurs. The life guards are there to prevent drowning. There are life savers, life jackets, and floaters available for children who can not swim.

Another tip is to make sure that there is a life guard at the pool the children will be swimming in. Also, if the swimming pool is outdoors, make sure the children wear sunscreen. Without it they can experience severe sunburn. In time this can lead to skin cancer.

Make sure that the children understand the reason for the pool rules. Make sure that they understand the need for sunscreen, and help them to understand that there are purposes for these precautions. The purpose is to prevent dangerous and unfortunate situations.
