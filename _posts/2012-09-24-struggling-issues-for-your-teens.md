This diagnosis like attention deficit has believers and non believers as to the legitimacy of it. Some people believe that when parents were able to use corporal punishment on their children there were not very many children who said they couldn&#8217;t help their behaviors because they had a disorder. There are those who will also say maybe that is why so and so turned out the way he did, because he was unable to obey authority. This help will usually require the parents to place their child outside of the home probably in another state.

Experts say that more and more teens are practicing something called &#8220;cutting,&#8221; a form of self-injury that helps them temporarily escape their problems.

Teens struggling with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may experience Obsessions &#8211; recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses that cause intrusive and disturbing anxiety or distress. People usually recognize that the obsessions don&#8217;t make a lot of sense. Troubled teens with OCD try to eliminate obsessions through compulsions &#8211; acts that are done over and over again and normally according to specific personal rules.

As the treatment progresses, the teenagers return home in an effort to begin to rebuild the family relationship. In the next stage they are allowed to take a newcomer into their home each night. And then they return to school or work to learn how to deal with negative peer pressure. They are expected to report to the facility after they get out of school or work.

Near the end of the treatment, the teenagers report to the facility less frequently and are expected to learn to manage their free time with family and friends who support their new drug-free life style

In the last stage, the adolescents help the staff and train to become program counselors. They are also encouraged to join adult self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and Over-eaters Anonymous.

If your teen is struggling with issues such as Depression, Substance Abuse, Authority Problems, ADHD/ADD, School Problems, Bipolar Issues, etc., perhaps some form of intervention is necessary.
