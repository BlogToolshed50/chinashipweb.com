Getting engaged is a huge move for anyone to make. It represents a commitment to a person that is at a deeper level than just dating, but not quite as deep as marriage. It usually signifies an intention to marry at a later date, but this isn’t always necessary. Engagement is usually also signified by an engagement ring of some sort which is presented when the question of engagement is brought up. In American culture, once a couple has agreed to engagement, they start planning their wedding, and set a date for the festivities to occur. In between the engagement and the wedding, there are many things that need to be planned out.

The first thing you should do after you get engaged is to set a date for the wedding that will undoubtedly occur in the future. Once you have an actual time frame determined, you will feel much better about everything. You will have an actual date to look forward to, and plenty of time to plan for it. After you have the date of the wedding set, you can begin to plan all of the smaller details. You may find that one of your mothers is into planning all of it, which will certainly take a load off of your shoulders. Mothers enjoy planning things, and a wedding is no different. So let her go to town, and just have everything run by you before it is decided for sure.

You also need to make invitations to your wedding, and send them out to everyone you can possibly think of who would like to attend it. Usually you will hire the services of a fancy printer in order to get all of the invitations made, and you may want to also hire a graphic designer to make an attractive template that you can base all of your invitations off of.

Overall, you will be dealing with literally hundreds of different things between proposing and getting married. It is best if you plan it all out very well, and simply take on one thing at a time. When you have everything planned out and you know when you will take care of things, this gives you a definite edge when planning a wedding. So just take it one step at a time, and don’t get overwhelmed by the amount of things that you have to consider.
