Dexter is currently the most watched TV series on Showtime. I first saw this show on Direct tv late one night while flipping through the channels. I was immediately hooked! Dexter is based off of a series of novels by writer Jeff Lindsay, and was adapted for television by Emmy Award winning screenwriter James Manos, Jr. The story revolves around Dexter Morgan (played by Michael C. Hall), who is a serial killer that works for the Miami Metro Police Department.

What is fascinating about Dexter is that he was adopted at an early age by a police officer after witnessing a horrific crime at a young age. He had a strong urge to kill, and his adoptive father shaped this need into a tool for eradicating criminals who slip through the cracks of the legal system. His day job is working as a blood splatter analyst for Miami Metro, and on the surface he seems quite ordinary, even a little bland. But after hours, Dexter is targeting, capturing and murdering despicable criminals. This controversial show provides a mix of horror and drama with a little bit of dry humor and a huge dose of wit. The script is unbelievably smart, and the action keeps the viewer hooked and on the edge of their seat from start to finish.
