Religion in broader sense is nothing but following certain well established culture that is prevalent over a period. Our fore-fathers have developed certain practices which became the culture and value in the society. Any religion should conduct itself duly adhering to such time tested values without eroding it. Any belief can be followed in the name of any religion, but it should be within the frame frame work of such culture and values that are followed and practiced in that area. This will ensure social harmony.
