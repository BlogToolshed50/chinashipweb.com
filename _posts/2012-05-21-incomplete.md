As teenagers and young adults, we’re focused on fitting in with peers and constructing our lives. Then kids come along and we focus on their needs. At the same time, most of us have parents that need care.

Then suddenly, we’re left standing in a field – not knowing which way to go. Many of us have never really taken the
  
time to think about what YOU want. What is it that would make YOU happy? Many people just shrug and resort to somehow passing the time until they die.

How do you be yourself, for yourself? Most people have no idea. You’ve been so busy building your life around
  
what others think and need, and trying to keep them happy that you’ve been lost in life’s shuffle. Instead of focusing on the way of life you’re lost, focus on what doors that opens up for you. What can you do
  
that you always wanted to do.
