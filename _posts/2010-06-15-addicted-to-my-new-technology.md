Thanks to Jill Axton for the guest post.

I still cannot get over how much technology has progressed over the past years when it comes to recording our favorite shows and movies. Ever since finding out how to use my DVR along with my direct tv New York, I have never had to miss a single show that I wanted to watch, but couldn&#8217;t. It doesn&#8217;t take long to become addicted to having every show that you can imagine at your fingertips. Even though I may miss recording a show when it first airs, I can go back and find out other times that the show will be playing during the week.

It has only been a few months since I got my hands on a DVR, but I have really been able to put it to good use since I have got it. It is kind of like having a virtual collection of all of your favorite shows all in one spot for when you are ready to watch them. Sometimes, I do not feel like sitting down and watching my shows when they first come on. After setting up my DVR to record them, the appropriate time is mine for the choosing. I am excited to see what will come next if technology continues to progress in the way that it has. Off to make use of the shows that haven&#8217;t been watched!
