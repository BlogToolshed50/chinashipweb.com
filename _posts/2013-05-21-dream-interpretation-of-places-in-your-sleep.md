Having those dreams again where you suddenly find yourself in the most unlikely places and weird locales? They say we are what we dream. And the venues of our dreams certainly say a lot about our hopes and fears in life. Read on to find out.

School:.

Dreams that happen in schools mean a return to childhood, back when we were just starting out in the arena of life. Schools are also one of the first venues where authority and discipline was exercised upon us, and where we meet other kids, so to dream of being in school may mean you are trying to face some unresolved issues about your adequacy, popularity, performance, and achievements. Dreaming of taking an exam in a school means we are facing challenges which we are afraid of being evaluated and judged.

Outer Space:.

Outer space dreams go hand in hand with the gift of flight. Thus, you are being adventurous and creative, to the point of being escapist. Being in outer space has a liberating feeling as well&#8211;weightlessness&#8211;add to this the fact that you are on top of things.

Game Show:.

Being a game show contestant in your dream signifies your concern about luck, and your performance in the public eye. It could also represent your wishful thinking for fame, even if it&#8217;s just a short-lived one.

Boxing Ring:.

Dreams of being in a boxing ring means your concern about performance, especially with regards to competition. Who is your opponent, and who between you is getting the most punches? You are in the spotlight, the center of attention when you are in the ring, and thus this dream means your need to prove yourself worthy.

Train:.

Trains are obedient vehicles; they religiously follow tracks and they stick to schedules of departures and arrivals. Trains, of course, mean journey. So dreams of being on the train represent a journey and transition in your life, unfolding according to schedules and neatly going along the tracks. Missing the train then, or being in a train wreck mean plans which you have let go out of hand.

Supermarket:.

Groceries offer an endless and tempting variety of things. To dream of being in a market means you are faced with tough choices, all of which look perfect and inviting. You are shopping not just for material things, but for things that relate to your emotional or social needs. You might be concerned of making the wrong choice in spending your money/attention/energy.

Road:.

Roads lead to places and possibilities. The kind of road you are treading in your dream and the scenery on either side reveal your current attitudes and motivations towards your goals. Winding, dark, and endless roads mean unsure and many hindrances, while smooth, well-paved ones mean stability.

Maze:.

More than just a physical manifestation, dreams of maze reveal our state of mind. Since mazes are convoluted passages that lead to dead-ends, or if not, back to where you started, then your dream of mazes signify a state of confusion which you need to get out of. Try getting a wider, aerial view of things, and you&#8217;ll see just where you want/need to be.

Parachute:.

Parachutes can either mean safety from sure harm or a welcome withdrawal/escape from constricting situations in your life. If you are enjoying the view below while you are in your parachute, then it means you are on top of things, and you have taken a wider perspective of things. If on the other hand, you can&#8217;t get your parachute open, then it means you are feeling betrayed by a friend or someone you have put your faith on.
