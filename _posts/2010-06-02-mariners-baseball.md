Every spring ushers in a new battle for baseball supremacy in Major League Baseball. From the great prospects during Spring Training, right through the months of spring and summer on the road to October, I&#8217;m completely enthralled with the ups and downs of my favorite team, the Seattle Mariners. I&#8217;ve been a fan of the Mariners for quite some time, and have been hoping for a repeat of their 2001 season, but it just hasn&#8217;t happened. I watch all of their games on my satellite tv. Even though it&#8217;s been hard to be a Mariners fan in recent years, I still get excited every single time I see them play.

The Seattle Mariners have a good squad of players and they have some of my favorites. Ken Griffey Jr, Ichiro Suzuki, Jack & Josh Wilson, Cliff Lee and so much more make up the lineup, of some of the best players in baseball. Despite the fact that the team hasn&#8217;t performed quite as well as others, the single parts that make up the team are simply put, amazing. I might be stretching the truth a little, but I can&#8217;t help it, the team has fascinated me for quite some time.

The Seattle Mariners are the top team in the northwest, and since I don&#8217;t live near Seattle anymore, I have been relying on my satellite TV to get me into the action. I get all the games, and in high definition, and I wear my Edgar Martinez jersey with pride, in hopes for a comeback of the 2001 Mariners, even thought it looks bleak right now.
