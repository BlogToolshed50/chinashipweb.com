Thanks to my friend Alex Mofrin for the guest post.

One of the best ways to spend each Monday evening for me is to sit back and watch Little People Big World. TLC is one of my most watched broadcasting channels that I subscribe to with my satellite tv nyc service. I really like how the show comes on a lot and that I am able to record all of the episodes ever made to watch at any given moment. The show features a family of little people that shed light as to how these types of people operate on a daily basis. I do not get the chance to see little people very often in real life, and I have to admit that they intrigue my somewhat.

I have been following this show for quite some time. I think that they are now in their 6th season. Hopefully, we will be able to see where the son, who is a little person also, handles the transition from adolescence to adulthood. they follow hom as he starts to go on dates, and deals with his own unique differences amongst his peers. I am still hoping for the one day that he really plants one on the girl that he is always shy around. maybe that will give him the courage to enjoy life to the fullest capacity. I guess that I will have to just keep watching!
