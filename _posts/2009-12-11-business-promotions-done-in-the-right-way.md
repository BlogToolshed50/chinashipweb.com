Business promotion, especially in the apparel sector has become the most important aspect to improve the profitability. With the growing competition amongst various countries like China, India and European countries, different business houses are following different methodology in marketing their product.

I stumbled upon an interesting fact recently that the &#8220;Model Women&#8221; used promoting the apparels to influence the customers. Mainly, the women folk&#8217;s decision to buy an apparel is highly influenced by their perception about the models. It is fascinating to know that the Ultra-thin models are found to be &#8220;bad for Business&#8221; as confirmed by so many servers and studies. The consumer preference was positive towards various brands that used the more diverse models rather than similar type. Use of extremely slim models can create a bad impression with female consumers. I was surprised to know from the study that the race, age and the shape influences consumers preference towards the product they advertise. A Canadian agency set up for non-traditional models clearly indicated that, invader to unleash new economic potential one need to represent your consumers physically. Paddy Bar wise, the professor of London Business School rightly observed that, there is a gap between what the consumers say, particularly in the presence of other women, and what they would actually do at the point of sale.

In general, the consumers have more favorable reaction to the brands that show models who represent their shape, age and background. So, keep in mind that your choice of models has got to direct impact on your business. Better choose the best one form the pint of view of your consumers.
