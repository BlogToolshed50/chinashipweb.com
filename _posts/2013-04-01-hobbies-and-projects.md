Anyone who enjoys crafts or hobbies knows the frustration of having to dig through everything to find what you need only to have to fight for a spot to work after the search. Many people stuff all of their items into a traditional closet and find it hard to use because they can&#8217;t see what they have. Custom closets designed specifically for your craft is exactly what you need. Everything is kept neat and tidy while still allowing you to see exactly what you have so there is more time to be creative and less time spent hunting.

Divided Shelving

Laminate sheets, paper, Bristol board, wood, and many other items are difficult to store because of their size and shape. You want to be able to see the types and colors you have, but they need to be protected so they don&#8217;t get bent or ruined. Divided cupboards in custom closes are the perfect solution. Vertical is best for larger sheets. A sliding door works to hide these cabinets when you aren&#8217;t using them.

Horizontal shelving is ideal for scrap-booking papers, stickers, and other small items. If you are concerned about having them fall out, consider having them installed at a thirty-degree angle and use shallow wire baskets. These are also great for yarns and other oddly shaped items.

Drawers

Smaller items such as pens, pencils, paints, and paintbrushes as well as supplies often pose a challenge for organizational systems. Having a series of small drawers is helpful for these kinds of items. You can fill them with spools, wooden shapes, die cuts and other items and keep everything separated. When you are ready to use them, you can pull the entire drawer out. For larger drawers, be sure to have movable dividers.

Specialty drawers such as pull out work-spaces are a convenient necessity for custom closets. They are great for holding your supplies while you&#8217;re working, or have them on the end of a counter-top to make it easy to work with larger projects.

Containers

Plastic dividable containers are the hobbyist&#8217;s best friend unless you don&#8217;t have enough space to stack them up. Make sure to include a number of shelves that fit your various containers perfectly. For more details www.caring-for-your-hamster.com Adding doors onto each will help you to hide the mass of containers when you&#8217;re finished. For supplies that are just too nice to hide away, custom closets can have glass sliding doors to keep out the dust.

For ribbon and rolls of paper, custom closets can have an area with lengths of dowel to feed them onto. If you keep the paper towards the work surface, you can inlay a measuring stick and use it to measure out what you need or use the edge of the counter top to tear it off. Have holes routed in the top to sink cups into. You can keep pencils, scissors, paperclips, and other small items in them while keeping them out of the way. For wreaths and other hang-able items, use pegboard as a backboard for the unit. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you have a huge space for a closet in Chicago or a small space in a New York apartment, the only rule with these types of storage spaces is to design them specifically for your items and habits.
