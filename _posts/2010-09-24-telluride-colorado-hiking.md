The article written by Alonso Kramer

I love to go hiking. Colorado offers some really exciting and beautiful places to hike. One of the places I love to go to is Telluride, Colorado. Prior to going hiking I set my security alarm so that I can rest assured my home is safe while I am gone. Finding Adt denver CO ended up being an easy task.

Telluride offers several hiking areas. The one that we take for a scenic view is the Coonskin Loop. Coonskin is a 1.3 mile trail that begins at St. Sophia Gondola and then loops back around to St. Sophia. My thirteen-year-old son loves to go hiking with me. We like to hike Coonskin in the summer time. It is best after days of rain because there are a lot of mushrooms to be seen. This trail is very easy going down but when you loop back up it can be tiresome. It is important to bring plenty of water. This is a super steep trail.

We also like the Telluride Trail that starts at St. Sophia Gondola and ends up in Telluride, Colorado. This trail is easy on the way down. It&#8217;s a nice size, well-marked trail. We like to use it to get exercise since it is 2.6 miles long. We usually park in Telluride, ride the Gondola to St. Sophia and hike down to Telluride. This trail is scenic too.

Both of the trails in Telluride are exciting to hike.
