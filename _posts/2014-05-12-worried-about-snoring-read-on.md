Just nudging your partner or going to the other room to sleep each time you hear a snore is not the best way to get relief from snoring. One of the main reasons for marital discords and strained relationships is sleep apnea.
  
Snoring is the noise is produced due to vibrations of the soft tissues in the throat as a direct result of constriction of air passages. When the soft tissues block the air passages, sleep apnea sets in.

There are many factors that lead to snoring which include abnormalities in the air passages and throat such as enlarged adenoids and tonsils. Sometimes, uvula or the soft tissue at the back of the throat can restrict air flow, causing intense vibration during breathing. Obese people have a higher tendency to snore as the layers of fat in the neck obstruct proper breathing. Alcohols and sedatives relax the muscles in and around the throat, tongue and soft tissues which in turn initiates. Sometimes, physical abnormalities such as problems in the nose cartilage increase the risk of sleep apnea.

There is a multitude of snoring treatments available ranging from oral applications to laser surgery. However, before jumping in the bandwagon and heading out to buy an oral appliance, look at your particular cause of snoring and get it evaluated by a doctor, if it is very severe. Doctors can check for the part of air passage that needs to be treated.

Sometimes many simple home remedies also work wonders. If you or your partner snores, try changing the sleeping position as sleeping on your side helps open air passages and reduces snoring. Losing weight, doing some exercises, special nasal drops and strips can actually do wonders. Nasal congestion are a main reason for snoring as the loose mucus membranes obstruct breathing. You can try steam inhalation adding a few drop of mint oil, which helps in decongestant, leading to less snoring.

Recent technological advancements and innovative research has brought about anti snoring remedies that are easily available. Some of the remedies include nasal drops which help in reducing snoring to a great deal. No only will you be able to sleep better but the reduced snores might put your marriage and relationship back on track too!
