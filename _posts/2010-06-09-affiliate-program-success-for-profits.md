The private label bottled drinking water is a growth industry with double digit growth and profit opportunities for the entrepreneur. But like most opportunities care must be taken to seek out and exploit the most profitable niche in the market.

A recent market study examined the growth and potential of the market for bottled water and concluded:

&#8220;The bottled water industry grew about 10% in 2005, while carbonated soft drinks revenue is essentially flat,&#8221; says Gary Hemphill, marketing director of BMC. &#8220;There are a couple of things driving the market—sure, people like to have a tap water substitution, but it&#8217;s really driven by people&#8217;s demands for a healthier alternative to the wide array of beverages on the market.&#8221;

Private label water is the fastest growing segment of the overall bottled water market and its future growth is considered by many to be “explosive”. .

Private label water combines the purity of refreshing drinking water with consumable advertising that is designed to an individual customer’s specification. The water is popular and the branding message, if designed properly, serves to promote business.

Almost every company in the United States can benefit from private label water with a custom branding message. The opportunities are huge, the market is largely untapped and the private label product is viewed by customers as a cost effective, power way to promote a brand message.

The bottled water industry consists of a number of interrelated parts including research and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales. Much of the business model however, requires significant amounts of capital and has high barriers to entry for most entrepreneurs.

Nevertheless, with the advent of the internet and e-commerce, an aggressive sales focused entrepreneur can develop a substantial profitable private label business through affiliate programs.
