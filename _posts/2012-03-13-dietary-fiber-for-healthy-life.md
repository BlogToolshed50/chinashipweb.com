Dietary fiber is an important nutrient. However, as with many commitments to better health, it doesn&#8217;t require a complete dietary change. Instead, the best method is to gradually include new sources of fiber into your existing diet. Consider trading white bread for a whole grain loaf and replacing chip or cracker snacks with high-fiber, low salt nuts. Vegetables and fruits that are high in fiber can also be blended into smoothies or shakes, making getting your daily fiber as easy as having a healthy beverage at the beginning and the end of each day.

Perhaps the best advice is to take a look at what you&#8217;re already eating, talk to a dietitian, and modify your diet to fit your personal needs. There are dozens of resources available for research on nutritional information, from government and independent sources alike. The results of these changes will definitely be helpful, leaving you nothing to lose but poor health.
